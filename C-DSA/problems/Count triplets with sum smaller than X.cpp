To solve the problem of finding the count of triplets (i, j, k) in an array `arr` such that their sum is less than a given value `sum`, and ensuring that `i < j < k`, we can use a more efficient approach with the help of sorting and the two-pointer technique.

Here's the corrected and optimized implementation of the solution:

1. **Sort the Array**: This will help in using the two-pointer technique effectively.
2. **Iterate Over the Array**: Fix one element and use two pointers to find the other two elements.
3. **Two-pointer Technique**: For each fixed element, use two pointers to find valid pairs.

Here's the code implementation:

```cpp
```

### Explanation:
1. **Sorting the Array**: This helps in simplifying the problem as it allows us to use the two-pointer technique effectively.
2. **Fixing the First Element**: We iterate over the array and fix the first element of the triplet.
3. **Two-pointer Technique**: For each fixed element `arr[i]`, we use two pointers:
   - `left` pointer starting from `i + 1`
   - `right` pointer starting from `n - 1`
   - We then check the sum of `arr[i] + arr[left] + arr[right]`. If it is less than the given `sum`, it means all triplets formed by `arr[i]`, `arr[left]`, and any element between `left + 1` and `right` will have a sum less than `sum`.
   - We then increment the `left` pointer to explore more pairs.
   - If the sum is not less than `sum`, we decrement the `right` pointer to try and reduce the sum.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid triplets with a time complexity of \(O(N^2)\), making it suitable for larger arrays compared to the brute force \(O(N^3)\) approach.
